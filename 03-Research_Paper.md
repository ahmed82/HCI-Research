# Paper Summary: 
`Building for ‘We’: Safety Settings for Couples with Memory Concerns`

1. **Main Issue**: The research addresses the issue of the safety of online uses for couples who have an illness of memory loss as it could be dangerous and could cause financially hard or other types of risks and losses since the person does not fully aware or not remembering what they click, and/or what was the link or website they were on. Also, the paper shows different scenarios to allow the people exam since some of the scenarios give the partner over power to allow the clicked link to be active or not as sometimes shifting power might trigger other person or partner's concerns.
 
2. **Approach**: The paper proposes several attempts to support couples to have safe internet surfing and online uses. The paper proposes a system design that applies a total of five safety settings informed by the issue of memory loss that has been pinpointed in previous work., this paper shows the results on several test scenarios for the five safety settings provided. The couple's partners who helped with the delivery to get the results, Remo referred to in the paper as ‘he” and Sydney as the researcher of this paper refer to her as “she”
 
3. **Related Work / Context**: The paper is built on top of previous research of the author, and also indicates several related research regarding the same issue of securing the life of couples who face memory loss, starting with related research that identified the role of couples as several argue about protecting the older adult who face the memory losses, also the paper have reference other researched work related to the designing system to protect that type of people as will protect their privacy 
 
4. **Evaluation / Analysis**: the paper shows that the experiment applied to a couple that the authors already studied in older research, the couples have a passion to try risk protection on a hypothetical system, to give deeper sees on the research I list a widely details about the different used scenarios of the system setting, starting with the setting could be set no interfere, just how you turn off computer antivirus, the second scenario is set to save all the links has been clicked by the partner to be review later, the third scenario if web link clicked the partner will get notification immediately, the fourth scenario if web link clicked the partner get notification immediately in order to review and approve before the link trigger loading the target URL, last scenario, that all links get deactivated, and in order to make the link clickable the partner needs to forward the wanted link to his partner to be discussed later. All of those links used for the evaluation have been sent through email.

5. **Lessons Learned:** People are accepting the idea of managing specific vectors and exactly links and senders in email, to be safe in some type of ledger or logs with an immediate alert, to both but unfortunately, a lot of consensuses that people have that not willing to have the security setting have full access to the history and sync and scan the unsafe link other than what is the actual action at the moment, as the people willing to have the ability to disable that feature in case of private use and not willing to share or give the security setting full access to the history to be shared and compared. However, the type of administration or dual oversees and control made the couple More unwilling to accept this idea as administration settings seem to shift the balance of power in the relationship, Moreover, it might be unfair. As other research shows that older adults may be willing to trade some privacy for autonomy.
