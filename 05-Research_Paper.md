## Paper Summary
**Main Issue:** Today, smart devices use touchscreens, which are often small or too bulky, add it adds difficulties to touch the screen with a big object such as smartphones or tablets. Moreover, some research criticizes tangible screen technology as the screen's hardware is costly. It has a significantly small size. This research paper addresses the issue of the tangibles for capacitive touchscreens size issue. 
**Approach:** the paper proposes a technique using 3D shapes as a fabrication and recognition approach for small-sized tangibles on off-the-shelf capacitive touchscreens. Fabrication pipeline for 3D printing and recognition of tangibles on capacitive touchscreens with a footprint as small as a fingertip. The research was beyond finger and hand identification. By enabling practitioners, the capacitive images quickly fabricate and sense tangible user interfaces, further enriching interaction on widespread capacitive touchscreens.
**Related Work / Context:** The author presents Itsy-Bits as an integrated design tool and 3D printed in a single pass without assembly. The researchers combine several approaches as a related work mentioned in the research paper, mainly considered as an extending work to three areas or topics:
Extending the expressiveness of interaction on touchscreens.
Recent related research focuses on extending the touchscreen area to recognize fingers and parts of the hand. Other researchers published research on palm vs. finger and left vs. right thumb.
Digital fabrication of interactive objects. 
Previous research presents work about adding interactive input and output functionalities in 3D-printed objects via light pipes by filling internal pipes with media post-print. Other related research used pipes to transmit sound. as mentioned, and other approaches print interactive objects using plastic or conductive spray.
Tangibles on touchscreens.
Authors listed recent research using optical markers, magnetic sensor grids, or localized NFC for localization and identification of tangibles on touchscreens. However, these approaches require additional sensing hardware or bulky setups.
**Evaluation / Analysis:** The evaluation was on testing a set of 10 rotation-variant common shapes in four different sizes. Using the above shapes, the authors collected extensive data for the machine learning study, including 269,867 capacitive images. While the difficulties were not accurately classifying the capacitive images, the research ended using a neural network divided into three branches: shape classification, size classification, and rotation regression. The analysis results to evaluate the study using the above shapes showed: over 95.57% for shape and the size over 98.63%. They were estimating the rotation error of 6.53Â° degrees.
Also, the authors contribute a fabrication pipeline model Itsy-Bit, a 3D-printed material composite consisting of grip structure, shape structure, and wiring structure to connect the hand grip with the definite shape. The creator performs three steps (design, print, interact). That shape is ready to use on the touchscreen immediately.
**Lessons Learned:** the study and the analysis of the large dataset of capacitive images open different future directions for using the touchscreen for games and applications. Also, the contribution of the fabrication pipeline Itsy-Bits provides Out-of-the-box solutions for game and application companies to produce.
